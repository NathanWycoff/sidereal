We want to make a function which wraps all the shiny stuff, that we just pass another function to and everything takes care of itself.

soon, we need to have:
    1) custom labels
    1.5) separate titles and the way we keep track of what's been touched in the server.
    5) The plot was square

someday, we would love it if:
    1) Way to have text with each point
    2) display old positions of points on hover
    3) moved points are different somehow, mabye color/size?
