We want to make a function which wraps all the shiny stuff, that we just pass another function to and everything takes care of itself.

soon, we need to have:
    1) custom labels
    1.5) separate titles and the way we keep track of what's been touched in the server.
    2) bugfix 1: onec update viz has been clicked, flush input$cool_id
    3) bugfix 2: session seems to crash if relaunching the webapp (though bugfix 1 may solve this.)
    4) bugfix 3: if a point is moved twice, we append instead of updating

someday, we would love it if:
    1) Way to have text with each point
    2) display old positions of points on hover
    3) moved points are different somehow, mabye color/size?
