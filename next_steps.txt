We want to make a function which wraps all the shiny stuff, that we just pass another function to and everything takes care of itself.

Some steps to this:
    1) Wrap the existing stuff as a function with no arguments
    2) customize arguments

someday, we would love it if:
    1) Way to have text with each point
    2) display old positions of points on hover
    3) moved points are different somehow, mabye color/size?
